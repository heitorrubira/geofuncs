# Geomatrix

This library aims to assist in Web or Node.js development, where it is necessary to apply basic geometric shapes, verify collisions between them, and apply mathematical formulas.

> Note: This is a work in progress, much of the code is being ported to TypeScript and will soon be available on NPM as well.

### 2D Shapes

**Vec2**: Point in two dimensions X, Y.
**Circle**: Circle with center and radius.

**Rect**: Rectangle with position, height, and width.

### 3D Shapes

**Vec3**: Point in three dimensions X, Y, and Z.
**Box**: Cubic-shaped with min and max positions.
**Sphere**: Spherical-shaped with center and radius.
